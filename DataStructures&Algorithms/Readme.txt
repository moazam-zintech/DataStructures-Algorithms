Arrays:

Two Sum: Given an array of numbers and a target sum, find a pair of numbers in the array that adds 
up to the target sum. 


Find the maximum subarray sum: Given an array of integers, find the subarray with the highest sum.


Container With Most Water: Given an array of positive integers where the width is always equal to 
the length of the array, find the container that could hold the most water.


Product of Array Except Self: Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] 
equals the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].




Linked Lists:

Reverse a Linked List: Reverse a singly linked list.



Detect Cycle in a Linked List: Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle.


Merge Two Sorted Lists: Merge two sorted linked lists and return a new sorted list.


Remove Nth Node from End of List: Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list 
and return its head.


Stacks and Queues:

Implement a stack: Design and implement a data structure for a Stack.


Implement a queue: Design and implement a data structure for a Queue.

Balanced parentheses: Given a string of parentheses, determine if the opening and closing parentheses
are balanced.

Trees:

Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in a Binary Tree: Given a binary tree and two nodes, find the lowest 
common ancestor (LCA) of the given nodes.
Binary Tree Level Order Traversal: Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its 
nodes' values. (Level order means traversing all nodes at a specific level before moving down to the next level.)
Maximum Depth of Binary Tree: Given a binary tree, find the height or maximum depth of the tree.
Hash Tables:

Find the first non-repeating character in a string: Given a string, find the first non-repeating 
character in it. (Hash tables are a great way to solve this problem.)
Two Sum (using a hash table): This is the same problem mentioned before, but this time solved 
using a hash table for faster lookups.
Sorting and Searching:

Merge Sort: Implement the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
Binary Search: Implement the binary search algorithm to search for a specific value in a sorted array.
Graphs:

Depth-First Search (DFS): Explain the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and implement it for a specific
graph problem.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explain the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm and implement it for a 
specific graph problem. (These were covered in the previous response)
